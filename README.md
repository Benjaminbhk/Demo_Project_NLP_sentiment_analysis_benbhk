## This project is a demonstration. In this project, I uses the Tesorflow.Keras library with an attention based Transformer to analyze the sentiment of a text. This model uses a transfer learning from the gensim-Word2Vec library (glove-wiki-gigaword).
## It may takes severals minutes to starts (cheap deployment as it is just a demonstration model)
