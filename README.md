# Sentiment Analysis with Streamlit
This project is a web application that performs sentiment analysis on a text input using an attention-based transformer model with transfer learning from the gensim Word2Vec library (glove-wiki-gigaword). The user interface is built using the Streamlit framework, which provides an interactive and user-friendly experience.
